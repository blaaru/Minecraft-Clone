Minecraft Clone

Minecraft clone using LWJGL3 and OpenGL.

This project includes:
- Basic movement mechanics
- A gradient skybox to mimic simple Minecraft sky effects
- A simple concept cube (no textures yet)

This project is currently a WIP. Everything is currently being done by OP.
More features are planned and am currently looking for ways to turn DEMO into an original voxel-based 3d game.
